"The HTTP `POST` request method is meant to transfer data to a server 
(and elicit a response). What data is returned depends on the implementation
of the server.

A `POST` request can pass parameters to the server using ""Query String 
Parameters"", as well as the Request Body. For example, in the following request,

> POST /hi/there?hand=wave
>
> <request-body>

The parameter ""hand"" has the value ""wave"". The request body can be in multiple
formats. These formats are defined by the MIME type of the request. The MIME 
Type can be set using the ``Content-Type`` HTTP header. The most commonly used 
MIME types are:

* `multipart/form-data`
* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
* `application/json`

This endpoint echoes the HTTP headers, request parameters, the contents of
the request body and the complete URI requested.","46","POST Raw Text","Postman Echo Request","Thu Oct 24 22:51:31 UTC 2024","passed","Thu Oct 24 22:51:31 UTC 2024","","Request Methods","",""

"The HTTP `PATCH` method is used to update resources on a server. The exact
use of `PATCH` requests depends on the server in question. There are a number
of server implementations which handle `PATCH` differently. Technically, 
`PATCH` supports both Query String parameters and a Request Body.

This endpoint accepts an HTTP `PATCH` request and provides debug information
such as the HTTP headers, Query String arguments, and the Request Body.","44","PATCH Request","Postman Echo Request","Thu Oct 24 22:51:31 UTC 2024","passed","Thu Oct 24 22:51:31 UTC 2024","","Request Methods","",""

"The HTTP `PUT` request method is similar to HTTP `POST`. It too is meant to 
transfer data to a server (and elicit a response). What data is returned depends on the implementation
of the server.

A `PUT` request can pass parameters to the server using ""Query String 
Parameters"", as well as the Request Body. For example, in the following 
raw HTTP request,

> PUT /hi/there?hand=wave
>
> <request-body>

"The HTTP `DELETE` method is used to delete resources on a server. The exact
use of `DELETE` requests depends on the server implementation. In general, 
`DELETE` requests support both, Query String parameters as well as a Request 
Body.

This endpoint accepts an HTTP `DELETE` request and provides debug information
such as the HTTP headers, Query String arguments, and the Request Body.","47","DELETE Request","Postman Echo Request","Thu Oct 24 22:51:31 UTC 2024","passed","Thu Oct 24 22:51:31 UTC 2024","","Request Methods","",""

"The HTTP `GET` request method is meant to retrieve data from a server. The data
is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). 

A `GET` request can pass parameters to the server using ""Query String 
Parameters"". For example, in the following request,

> http://example.com/hi/there?hand=wave

The parameter ""hand"" has the value ""wave"".
